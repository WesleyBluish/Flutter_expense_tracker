# Expense Tracker Mobile App

## Overview
This project is a simple yet functional **Expense Tracker Mobile Application** built using Dart with Flutter. After gaining experience in developing a web-based expense tracker, I decided to extend my knowledge and apply it to mobile app development. The app is designed to help users manage their daily expenses efficiently by adding, viewing, and categorizing transactions.

## Features
- Add new transactions with a title, amount, and date.
- View recent transactions and overall expenses.
- Toggle between chart and list views for a clear visual representation of expenses.
- Delete transactions as needed.

## Technologies Used
- **Dart**: Programming language used for app logic.
- **Flutter**: Framework used for building the mobile user interface and handling cross-platform development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) should be installed on your machine.
- A suitable code editor, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WesleyBluish/Flutter_expense_tracker
   cd expense_tracker_application
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   - On an emulator or a connected device, execute:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of data persistence (e.g., local storage or database).
- Implementing charts to provide better visual insight into spending habits.
- Adding categories to group expenses.
