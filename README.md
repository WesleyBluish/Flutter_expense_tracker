Expense Tracker Mobile App
Overview
This project is a simple yet functional Expense Tracker Mobile Application built using Dart with Flutter. After gaining experience in developing a web-based expense tracker, I decided to extend my knowledge and apply it to mobile app development. The app is designed to help users manage their daily expenses efficiently by adding, viewing, and categorizing transactions.

Features
Add new transactions with a title, amount, and date.
View recent transactions and overall expenses.
Toggle between chart and list views for a clear visual representation of expenses.
Delete transactions as needed.
Technologies Used
Dart: Programming language used for app logic.
Flutter: Framework used for building the mobile user interface and handling cross-platform development.
